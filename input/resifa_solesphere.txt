AGC Chemicals Americas has introduced RESIFA™ SOLESPHERE™ silica particles, an innovative solution for efficient carbon dioxide (CO₂) absorption.



RESIFA™ SOLESPHERE™ silica particles for carbon capture from AGC Chemicals Americas.

With their unique microspherical shape and exceptional pore volume, these advanced mesoporous silica grades deliver superior performance as solid sorbents for carbon capture. Available in three versatile forms—bare silica, silica pellets and AGC’s proprietary amine-treated silica pellets—SOLESPHERE silica sets a new standard in CO₂ absorption technology.

Key features of SOLESPHERE fine silica that maximize CO₂ capture efficiency include:

Highly porous structure: Pore volume of up to 2.0 ml/g, with a pore diameter of 50 nm that effectively traps and retains CO₂ molecules
Air-stable, heat-resistant amines: Ensure thermal stability and reliable capture efficiency
Energy-efficient design: When matched with the best amine, SOLESPHERE silica’s high porosity and surface area reduce the energy required for CO₂ absorption and release.
Customizable solutions: Available in various particle sizes and porosities to meet specific carbon capture needs.
